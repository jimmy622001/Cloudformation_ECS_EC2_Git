Subject: Unable to delete AWS Organization due to suspended/closed member accounts

Account ID: 667021093945
Organization ID: (from your AWS Console)

Issue Description:
I am trying to delete my AWS Organization but cannot remove member accounts due to constraint violations. The member accounts are showing as SUSPENDED/CLOSED but still prevent organization deletion.

Member Accounts:
- audit (604224672061) - Status: SUSPENDED
- Audit (881455453167) - Status: SUSPENDED  
- Dimitri (325428505676) - Status: SUSPENDED
- website (129929455171) - Status: SUSPENDED

Error Messages:
1. When trying to remove accounts: "The member account is missing one or more of the prerequisites required to operate as a standalone account"
2. When trying to delete organization: "To delete an organization you must first remove all member accounts (except the master)"

Request:
Please help remove these suspended/closed member accounts from the organization so I can delete the organization, or delete the organization directly.

Steps Already Attempted:
- Tried removing accounts via AWS CLI
- Tried closing accounts
- All accounts show as CLOSED in console but SUSPENDED via CLI
